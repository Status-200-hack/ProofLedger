## Realistic Constraints and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
**IPFS Reliability**: Long-term content availability depends on network health and pinning services
**Blockchain Costs**: Ethereum gas fees may limit adoption during network congestion
**Scalability**: Current architecture handles thousands of proofs, not millions

### Market Challenges
**User Education**: Web3 concepts still require significant user onboarding
**Regulatory Uncertainty**: Legal recognition of blockchain proofs varies by jurisdiction
**Competition**: Established players may develop similar solutions

### Resource Requirements
**Development Team**: Core features require 2-3 full-time developers
**Infrastructure Costs**: IPFS pinning and hosting costs scale with usage
**Legal Compliance**: Regulatory compliance may require specialized expertise

## Success Metrics and Milestones

### Year 1 Targets
- 10,000+ proofs created
- 100+ daily active users
- 5+ enterprise partnerships
- 99.9% proof verification uptime

### Year 2 Targets
- 100,000+ proofs created
- 1,000+ daily active users
- Multi-chain deployment
- API adoption by 50+ developers

### Year 3 Targets
- 1,000,000+ proofs created
- 10,000+ daily active users
- Legal recognition in major jurisdictions
- Self-sustaining ecosystem

## Why This Roadmap Works

**Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers immediate user benefits
**Technical Foundation**: Current architecture supports planned expansions
